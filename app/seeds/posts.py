# Uses a raw SQL query to TRUNCATE or DELETE the users table. SQLAlchemy doesn't

# removes all the data from the table, and RESET IDENTITY resets the auto
# incrementing primary key, CASCADE deletes any dependent entities.  With
# sqlite3 in development you need to instead use DELETE to remove all data and
# it will reset the primary keys for you as well.
